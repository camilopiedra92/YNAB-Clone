# Handling Credit Cards in YNAB

**Principle:** Spending decisions are based on category Available amounts, not the payment method itself.

## How Credit Cards Work in YNAB

When you spend money on a credit card, you are creating debt. YNAB handles this by moving money from the spending category to the Credit Card Payment category.

1.  **Assign Money:** You assign money to a spending category (e.g., Groceries).
2.  **Spend:** You use your credit card for a purchase in that category.
3.  **Auto-Move:** YNAB automatically moves the funds from the spending category (Groceries) to the Credit Card Payment category. The money is now reserved to pay the credit card bill.

### The Flow

- **Before Purchase:** Money is in the _spending category_ (Available).
- **After Purchase:** Money moves to the _Credit Card Payment category_ (Available for payment).
- **Payment:** When you pay the bill, you use the money in the _Credit Card Payment category_.

## Do I Need to Assign Money Directly to My Credit Card Payment Category?

**Generally, NO.** YNAB moves money automatically for funded spending.

**Exceptions (When you DO need to assign money directly):**

1.  **Paid in Full Cards (Starting Balance):**
    - When you first add a card you pay in full, the starting balance represents pre-YNAB spending. No money moved automatically for this.
    - You must **manually assign** funds equal to the starting balance to the Credit Card Payment category.

2.  **Additional Payments (Dealing with Debt):**
    - If you are paying down old debt (spending not covered by current budgeting), assign extra money directly to the Payment category.

3.  **Credit Card Overspending:**
    - If a category was overspent _on credit_ in a previous month, the debt remains.
    - You must budget directly to the Payment category in the current month to cover this.

4.  **Overpayments and Positive Balances:**
    - If a card has a positive balance (the bank owes you), YNAB treats it like cash.
    - No money moves to the Payment category until the balance goes negative again.

5.  **Outflow Balance Adjustments (Transfers):**
    - Balance transfers (moving debt from one card to another) do not trigger auto-moves.
    - You must manually assign money to cover the transfer if needed.

## How to Close a Credit Card Account

1.  **Zero Balance:** The account balance must be $0.00. (Make an adjustment or payment if needed).
2.  **Close Account:** Use the 'Close Account' button/option.
3.  **Hide Category:**
    - Ensure the Credit Card Payment category has $0.00 Available.
    - Hide the category.
